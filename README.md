## Introduction

In this course, you'll learn to make a website without using just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll build a simple, single-page website that gets information from another website and shows it on your site. You'll also learn how to test and improve your site's design. By the end, you'll be able to create mock-up websites with real info and understand how websites work behind the scenes.

## Assignment

1. Build your own SPA/Website with external data from an API with minimal 1 micro-interaction.
2. A TeamApp with a collection of all the individual websites of your team members.

Code structure* - you write modular, consistent and efficient HTML, CSS and JavaScript code by applying structure and best practices. You manage state for the application and the UI

Data management* - you understand how you can work with an external API using asynchronous code. You can retrieve data, manipulate and dynamically convert it to structured html

Project* - your app is working and published on GitHub Pages. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository.

- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages üåê
