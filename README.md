## :wrench: INTRODUCTION

This website is built using just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've created a simple, single-page website that retrieves information from another website and displays it here. Through this project, I've learned how to test and improve site design, allowing me to create mock-up websites with real information and gain a deeper understanding of how websites work behind the scenes.

## :page_with_curl: ASSIGNMENT

During this course, I should:

1. Develop a single-page application (SPA) or website incorporating external data from an API, complete with at least one micro-interaction.
2. Collaborate on a team app that features the individual websites of each team member.

## :white_check_mark: THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT

My efforts are assessed using a rubric. I must pass the criteria below to pass the grade:

The project;

- is made with clean vanilla HTML, CSS en Javascript,
- includes diverse content,
- includes at least one micro-interaction made in detail using JS,
- includes at least one data-connection through an API call,
- includes the correct data for the integration with the team app,
- is accessible,
- has a professional design and styling,
- is completely responsive,
- is documented.
