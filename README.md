## :wrench: Introduction

In this course, you'll learn to make a website without using just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll build a simple, single-page website that gets information from another website and shows it on your site. You'll also learn how to test and improve your site's design. By the end, you'll be able to create mock-up websites with real info and understand how websites work behind the scenes.

## :page_with_curl: Assignment

1. Build your own SPA/Website with external data from an API with minimal 1 micro-interaction.
2. A team app with a collection of all the individual websites of your team members.

## :white_check_mark: The requirements of the assessment

Your efforts are assessed using a rubric. You must pass the criteria below to pass the grade:

The project;

- is made with tidy vanilla HTML, CSS en Javascript,
